# DESCRIPTION
  Simple and cheap Arduino heart rate sensor. In this article we will build a simple heart rate sensor, it can graph a very crude ECG and with it you can get the heart rate of the patient

This article is in sponsored by JLCPCB, I'm very thankful for them helping me with this project. Thank you!

# Ordering the PCBs from JLCPCB:


Now we have got the PCB design and it’s time to order the PCB’s. For that, you just have to go to JLCPCB.com, and click on “QUOTE NOW” button.

JLCPCB are also sponsor of this project. JLCPCB (ShenzhenJLC Electronics Co., Ltd.), is the largest PCB prototype enterprise in China and a high-tech manufacturer specializing in quick PCB prototype and small-batch PCB production. You can order a minimum of 5 PCBs for just $2.

# Add your Gerber File:


To get the PCB manufactured, upload the gerber file you downloaded in the last step. Upload the.zip file or you can also drag and drop the gerber files.

# Finalizing your order:


After uploading the zip file, you’ll see a preview of your pcb if the file is successfully uploaded.You can review the PCB in the Gerber viewer to make sure everything is good. You can view both top and bottom of the PCB.

After making sure our PCB looks good, we can now place the order at a reasonable price. You can order 5 PCBs for just $2 but if it’s your first order then you can get 10 PCBs for $2. To place the order, click on “SAVE TO CART” button. My PCBs took 2 days to get manufactured and arrived within a week using DHL delivery option. PCBs were well packed and the quality was really good.
